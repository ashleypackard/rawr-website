	<h2>Bring the Mesozoic Era to your home!</h2>

	<p>

		Using the latest scientific advancements, technology, and the tiniest sliver of dinosaur DNA found by our own archeologists, the scientists at RAWR were able to unlock the secrets of the dinosaurs. We have successfully cloned every dinosaur DNA imaginable and you can bring one home today! 

	</p>

	<p>

			Here at RAWR we believe every child should experience the unique opportunity to own their very own dinosaur and so we mutated the genes of our dinosaurs to weed out aggressivesness. In our store you can purchase whole kits for hatching any egg you desire. If you're not into the hatching process we can hatch it for you and all you have to do is come pick it up. Make a trip out of it and spend time at our resort and spa to relax and bond with your new little addition to the family.

		<h2>Behind the Technology</h2>

		<p>
				The scientists at RAWR have taken the DNA smamples found from a 10,000 year old bone fragment found in the darkest depths of the Grand Canyon and were able to restore it. Combining the ancient DNA strands with reptile DNA we were able to reproduce the dinosuar population. We started with just humble beginnings and one dinosaur and turned it into an empire. Dinosaurs can now be seen roaming about everywhere. Get your pet dinosaur today!
