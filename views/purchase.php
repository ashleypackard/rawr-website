		  		<p>Insert your store items here, use a table or just use the grid system from bootstrap, whatever you'd like!</p>

		  		<p>When starting delete this two paragraphs and this is your whole area to work! If using the grid system make sure that you have &lt;div class="row"&gt; and then a &lt;div class="col-md-X"&gt; Note that all col-md 's must add up to 12 in each row. You can have any combination: 11 and 1, or 4, 2, 1, 2, 3. As long as it equals 12. You can even have a col-md-12. The md is just for medium, don't worry about it :D </p>

		  		<p>Look at the code in the Our Dinosaurs page for help. Ask me or visit <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid" target="_blank">Twitter Bootsrap Grid System</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootsrap JS</a> for cool ideas.
