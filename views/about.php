<h1>All About Re-established Archetypical Wiped-out Reptiles (RAWR)</h1>

<p>We are the only company in the world selling dinosaurs!  Yes real life dinosaurs!!!
We sell these reptiles <br/> in order to give them a forever home.  Can you imagine dinosaurs trying to live in the current times? <br/>
From now on we can coexist with dinosaurs as our pets.  These dinosaurs can be trained to live with you <br/>much like a dog or cat.   
It is our belief that families will find enjoyment with dinosaurs as pets.  Don't worry,<br/> we only sell herbivores.</p>

<p>Here at RAWR we supply absolutely everything you need to care for your dinosaur.  After all, if we didn't who would? <br/>
We have all the supplies you need for taking care of your dinosaur from food to medicine as well as <br/>accessories for your dinosaur.
Our support team is the best in the nation for helping you to keep a dinosaur <br/> as your family pet! </p>

<p>It is our wish to keep these dinosaurs safe and give them good homes because they do make great friendly pets! <br/>
We raise dinosaurs in our headquarters and we sell dinosaur eggs as well so that you can raise your own dinosaur from <br/>
the very beginning of it's life!  Due to our business, our patrons ask many questions so that they feel satisfied with <br/>
their decision of bringing home a pet dinosaur.</p>

<p>The number one question we get is: 'where on Earth do you find dinosaurs to sell?!'  The answer is that our team of <br/>
paleontologists discovered dinosaur eggs in a secret location that we may not publicly share.  However, these eggs and dinosaurs <br/>
are real and we do not offer any carnivorous dinosaurs or dinosaur eggs.  In fact, we give the carnivorous dinosaurs to scientists <br/>
in order for them to better understand Earth much before humans arrived. </p>

<p>Just look at one patron who seems to be loving their new pets!!! <br/>
