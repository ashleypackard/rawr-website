			<p id="topText">Caring for your dinosaur is surprisingly easy!  Besides you have us to help you!
			First off, you need the proper food for your dinosaur who happens to be on a strictly plant diet!
			Don't think that your home garden can support your new pet because most of the dinosaurs we offer eat
			high volumes of food because their food is often low in calories.  Each dinosaur has a different meal plan
			based on their digestive system and teeth, but, when you buy from else we help you set up a meal plan.
			Also, let your dinosaur eat some rocks when it wants to; these rocks help grind up fibers in their digestive
			system left over from eating roots and twigs.  Again, based on your purchase we will help you to know your
			specific dinosaur's needs.

			<p id="middleText">In order to keep your dinosaur in shape they need a lot of exercise.  We recommend walking your dinosaur
			regularly just as you would with a dog.  Dinosaurs like to roam and it is rare that herbivores move quickly unless
			they are in danger.  You can use our super strength leashes to control your new pet on your walks.  On your walks 
			you can expect your dinosaur to eat much of the wild plants along the way.  When our professionals walk our dinosaurs
			they use plant packs to lead the dinosaurs on a walk.

				Grooming has never been easier! Once a week your dinosaur needs a good rise to get any dirt off of them.
				We've found that if you live near a deep lake or near the ocean, your dinosaur would love to go for a swim 
				rather than get rinsed off.  Also, the warmer the area you live in the better!  Along with the heat the 
				dinosaurs need mud to cool off as well.  If you do not live in a hot area with plenty of rain, taking care of 
				your dinosaur will be more difficult.
