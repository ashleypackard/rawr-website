<h1>How To Care For Your Dinosaur!</h1>


<p>Caring for your dinosaur is surprisingly easy!  Besides you have us to help you! <br/>
First off, you need the proper food for your dinosaur who happens to be on a strictly plant diet! <br/>
Don't think that your home garden can support your new pet because most of the dinosaurs we offer eat <br/>
high volumes of food because their food is often low in calories.  Each dinosaur has a different meal plan <br/>
based on their digestive system and teeth, but, when you buy from else we help you set up a meal plan. <br/>
Also, let your dinosaur eat some rocks when it wants to; these rocks help grind up fibers in their digestive <br/>
system left over from eating roots and twigs.  Again, based on your purchase we will help you to know your <br/>
specific dinosaur's needs. <br/>

<p>In order to keep your dinosaur in shape they need a lot of exercise.  We recommend walking your dinosaur <br/>
regularly just as you would with a dog.  Dinosaurs like to roam and it is rare that herbivores move quickly unless <br/>
they are in danger.  You can use our super strength leashes to control your new pet on your walks.  On your walks <br/>
you can expect your dinosaur to eat much of the wild plants along the way.  When our professionals walk our dinosaurs <br/>
they use plant packs to lead the dinosaurs on a walk. <br/>

<p>Grooming has never been easier!  Once a week your dinosaur needs a good rise to get any dirt off of them.<br/>
We've found that if you live near a deep lake or near the ocean, your dinosaur would love to go for a swim <br/>
rather than get rinsed off.  Also, the warmer the area you live in the better!  Along with the heat the <br/>
dinosaurs need mud to cool off as well.  If you do not live in a hot area with plenty of rain, taking care of <br/>
your dinosaur will be more difficult. <br/>
